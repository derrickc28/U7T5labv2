    // of Integers (rather than an array of ints) and a target int; return the first index
    // at which the target is found, or return -1 if target is not found
    // BE SURE TO USE EARLY RETURN





    // D. provide another OVERLOADED version of the linearSearch method that accepts an array
    // of Strings and a target String; return the first index at which the target is found,
    // or return -1 if target is not found
    // BE SURE TO USE EARLY RETURN





    // E. write a "linearSearchLast" method that accepts an array of ints and a
    // target int, and return the LAST index at which the target is found,
    // or return -1 if target is not found





    // F. write two static "linearSearchCount" methods (both overloaded), one that
    // accepts an array of ints and a target int, and the other that accepts an ArrayList
    // of Integers and a target int.  Each method should return the NUMBER OF TIMES
    // the target appears in the array/ArrayList.
